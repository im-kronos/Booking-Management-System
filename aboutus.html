                    <hr>
                    <pre>
                        BookMyShow was founded by Dharshan M of Lovely Professional University.
                        The major purpose of this start-up was to bring the concept of online movie ticketing to India. And soon as it expanded,
                        it started offering online ticketing solutions for theatres, events, concerts and sports.
                        During its initial years, the startup had a small team managing all the operations. It now employs more than 400 people.
                        Friday Filmhouse's online ticketing platform is considered to be the main reason behind its success.

                    sports tickets. Apart from being an online ticketing portal, it offers information about upcoming movies and
                    events, show timings, venue details and artist bios.</pre>
